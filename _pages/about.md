Currently I am a senior researcher at Utrecht University, affiliated with the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/ai-data-science/ai-technology-for-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Technology for Life</a> initiative and the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/biomolecular-mass-spectrometry-and-proteomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics</a> group. I work on safe, trustworthy AI: at present this centers on developing efficient foundation models for mass spectrometry while integrating principled epistemic uncertainty to ensure reliability in downstream scientific and clinical interpretation. 

I have a broad, hands-on background spanning symbolic and data‑driven AI. My research has consistently focused on making learning more efficient (optimization, compact architectures) and making model behavior more transparent. I have developed axiomatic and game‑theoretic explanation frameworks (including Shapley‑based and interaction‑aware formulations) for a range of machine learning models, aiming for explanations that are computationally tractable yet faithful. In decision‑making, I study preference modeling under uncertainty—designing methods that aggregate, rank, and analyze criteria and stakeholder inputs in probabilistic, robust ways. 

Earlier, during my Ph.D. in the Netherlands—awarded <em>cum laude</em>, the highest distinction in Dutch academia—I introduced simulated annealing approaches and rigorous statistical evaluation techniques for ontology alignment, with applications to logistics interoperability. Subsequent postdoctoral work at Eindhoven (JADS / TU/e ecosystem) and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam broadened this into explainable AI for medicine, guideline linkage, and knowledge‑centric reasoning. I aim to build methods that are modest in assumptions yet precise in guarantees, and remain assertive about reproducibility and clarity.
