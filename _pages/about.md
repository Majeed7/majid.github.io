Currently I am a senior researcher at Utrecht University, affiliated with the 
<a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/ai-data-science/ai-technology-for-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Technology for Life</a> initiative and the 
<a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/biomolecular-mass-spectrometry-and-proteomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics</a> group. 

My work bridges interpretable and causality-aware machine learning, multi-criteria decision making, and AI for scientific discovery—especially in healthcare, proteomics, and knowledge-intensive domains. I design methods that produce faithful local and global explanations (e.g., Shapley and game-theoretic formulations), enable robust ranking and aggregation, and advance transparency in data-driven decision pipelines.

Academic Path
======
I earned my Ph.D. in the Netherlands (awarded <em>cum laude</em>, the highest distinction in Dutch academia) where I developed simulated annealing and statistical evaluation frameworks for ontology alignment and logistics interoperability. After my Ph.D. I held postdoctoral positions at Eindhoven (JADS / TU/e ecosystem) and Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam (AI in Medicine), focusing on explainable AI for clinical guidelines, knowledge graph–driven reasoning, and trustworthy model interpretation. I have also collaborated with industry and research partners on applications spanning mass spectrometry, clinical search, and infrastructure code analysis.

Selected Research Themes
======
- Interpretable & game-theoretic machine learning (exact Shapley for kernel models)
- Multi-criteria and group decision analysis (probabilistic and Bayesian ranking)
- Clinical and biomedical AI (guideline linkage, proteomics representation learning)
- Reliable model explanation & interaction detection (non-additive local explanations)

Affiliations & Collaboration
======
At Utrecht University I contribute to GenAI for Mass Spectrometry and cross-disciplinary AI for Life initiatives. I previously engaged with VU Amsterdam on medical AI, and Eindhoven/JADS on cybersecurity, software analytics, and interpretable neural optimization. International collaborations include PostNetAI fellowships exploring kernel discrepancy measures and causality-aware attribution.

Distinctions
======
<em>Cum laude</em> Ph.D. distinction; multiple invited collaborations (CISPA, Marburg University); contributions to ontology alignment evaluation campaigns and explanatory AI workshops.
