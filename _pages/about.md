Currently I am a senior researcher at Utrecht University, affiliated with the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/ai-data-science/ai-technology-for-life" target="_blank" rel="noopener">AI Technology for Life</a> initiative and the <a href="https://www.uu.nl/en/research/biomolecular-mass-spectrometry-and-proteomics" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Biomolecular Mass Spectrometry and Proteomics</a> group. I work on safe, trustworthy AI: at present this centers on developing efficient foundation models for mass spectrometry while integrating principled epistemic uncertainty to ensure reliability in downstream scientific and clinical interpretation. 

I have a broad, hands-on background spanning symbolic and data‑driven AI. My research has consistently focused on making learning more efficient (optimization, compact architectures) and making model behavior more transparent. I have developed axiomatic and game‑theoretic explanation frameworks (including Shapley‑based and interaction‑aware formulations) for a range of machine learning models, aiming for explanations that are computationally tractable yet faithful. In decision‑making, I study preference modeling under uncertainty—designing methods that aggregate, rank, and analyze criteria and stakeholder inputs in probabilistic, robust ways. 

Previously, I completed my Ph.D. at TU Delft, awarded <em>cum laude</em>, the highest distinction in Dutch academia. I then held postdoctoral positions within the JADS / Eindhoven University of Technology ecosystem and in the Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam Learning and Reasoning group. These appointments broadened my perspective across explainable AI, scientific data integration, and knowledge‑centric reasoning. My approach is modest in assumptions, precise in guarantees, and assertive about reproducibility and clarity. For structured details (education, roles) see the <a href="/cv/">CV</a>.
